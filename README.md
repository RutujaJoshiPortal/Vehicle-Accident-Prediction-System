Designed and built a prototype of a vehicle that provides a predictive model with maximum 
accuracy by using TensorFlow as part of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm along with that ADAS feature is used based on input factors like driverâ€™s 
fatigue, speed, and distance between two vehicles.
